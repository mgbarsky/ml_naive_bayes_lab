Some movies truly just want to tell a story. A heart-warming, touching tale with charming characters whose lives you're just invested in for an hour and thirty minutes. Flipped is perfectly such a movie. While it's definitely about puppy love and the dazzling eyes you see the first time you meet your crush, this movie explores an honest and real look at how such young love is surrounder by so many emotions and feelings. 

And believe me, feelings are what you'll get once you decide to watch this <3
