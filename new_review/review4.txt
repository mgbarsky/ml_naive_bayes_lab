This movie was awesome!! I wasn’t born in the 1900’s but it brought out a feeling I’ve never felt before. The ending is what I excepted but not completely. I was hoping they kissed because of what Julie mentioned at the beginning. So It felt un-filling at the end but it was still a great film. Totally recommend.
