I think this movie is so pure and that is what I love about it . it is friendly and funny and romantic at the same time . The acting is amazing and I do not think anyone in this whole world has something bad to say about it . people usually find issues from good movies but I think the only thing that is not likely in this one is the fact that the main characters did not kiss . They put so many details in the movie that sometimes you feel like you are living in their world . the other fact that I love about it that the teen characters were played by teens . you can watch it over and over again without getting bored or tired . everyone can watch it teens , parents . you can watch it with your family , with your friends , you can watch it on your own . IT IS TRULY A MASTERPIECE
